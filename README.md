## What's this?
It's a collection of code examples, simple apps, and other goodness for everything Javascript.
These code examples represent work from my own independent learning, examples from 
books, snippets from blogs/articles, and github repos.  Credit for original sources
will be cited in work that is not my own.


## Purpose
The goal is to create a representative sample of modern front-end JavaScript
code that enables developers to become more effective in real-world development.
