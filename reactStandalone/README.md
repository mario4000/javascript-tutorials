# react-standalone


## Description
Use this package to write ReactJS from scratch.
Build React wrapper, presentation, style, and
functional components without a complicated
toolchain.  The goal of this exercise is to use
single-file javascript dependencies in a single
index.html file to build a view with props.  
This will enhance understanding about React's
pure JS capabilities.

## Instructions

1. Copy / paste the `template` directory on your
   local machine.

2. Rename the `template` directory (ex: "Site1").

3. Run `npm i` in your new directory to install
   node module dependencies.

4. Run `npm start` to start the local server.   

5. Open `yourNewDirectory -> public -> index.html`
   and review JS file dependencies (babel, react,
   react-dom, etc).

6. Write React components in  
   `yourNewDirectory -> public -> js -> app.js`.
   Hot loading is enabled, so changes will be
   reflected on screen.

7. Create app seed data in
   `yourNewDirectory -> public -> js -> seedData.js`.

8. Explore and have fun with React!!!
