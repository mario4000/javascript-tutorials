# reactReduxTodoList
Implementing a simple "to-do list" app using
`reactjs`, `redux`, `json-server`, and
`create-react-app`.

## Installation
Use the command line to install all dependencies
via npm.

``` sh

$ npm i

```

## Usage
You'll need to run a local `json-server` instance
to render the React application.  Use these commands
to start:

``` sh

# start json-server using port 8080.
# initial data is provided in
# db.json file
$ npm run dev-server

# start todo list application
$ npm run start

```

## Notes

- The application was built in stages.  It began with static html and progressed to redux + json-server data.

- Review the commit history to see each stage to development.  File comments atop "App.js" describe the update made for each commit.
